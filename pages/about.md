## About the Collection

A Decade of Philippine Indie is a collection of Filipino independent films, specifically Cinemalaya and CinemaOne Originals from 2010-2019. Here, we provide important information and essential details about Filipino indie films to help you get to know them better and hopefully bring them into light. As Iskolars ng Bayan, we believe that we do not only learn through our academics – but also through lessons about love, humanity, justice, and the likes given by the artistic creations and magnum opuses of Filipino filmmakers and artists themselves. With that, we also want to impart the wisdom and influence these films have bestowed upon us by being the source of must-watch Filipino movies. Through one click, you may already witness the culture and artistry embedded in these films – showcasing the legacy of filmmaking in the Philippines.

## Creators of the Site

This collection is made by a group of 5 movie enthusiasts from the University of the Philippines-Diliman: Michael Balili, Kelly Bitangcol, Mia Cunanan, Julia Jimenez, and Karl Sabugal. 

We're sincerely hoping that our collection aids in fostering more appreciation and support towards the outstanding Filipino movie scene!
